## Nocturnal Nightmares Remastered

This is a companion repo for a YouTube video I made about a game I 
made when I was 13 years old, and my efforts to improve it.

## Components

### DOS Efforts

Both directories contain Borland C 3.1 code that compiles fine
under dosbox. Executables are provided for those who don't want
to figure out the toolchain.

* `pal` is the palette cycling code

* `texture` is the version where I draw higher resolution textures
every frame using assembly code. 

### The "Modern" Remake

* `remake` is a Godot 3.5 project. If you have Godot it should build
only any platform, although I've only tried it so far on Mac OSX.
